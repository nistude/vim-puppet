This is a collection of files from several places:

- ftdetect and syntax from puppet/ext/vim
- snippets from R.I.Pienaar

INSTALLATION

If you are using pathogen to manage your vim modules, put vim-puppet into
your ~/.vim/bundle/ directory. Otherwise place the files in appropriate
places under ~/.vim/.
